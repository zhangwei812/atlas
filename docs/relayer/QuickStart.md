# How To Become Relayer

## Step 1: Insure your account has sufficient balance

In order to join election, the account balance should have 100000 MAP at least. Then using 100000 MAP to register at contract.

## Step 2: Join relayer election 

When balance is more 100000 MAP at contract, the validitor will join election at election point that it is block number that counts backwards 200 at a multiple of ten thousand generally.

It is Auto-completion by our system. the validitor is 100% selected at first times, only if the list of being selected isn't full.   

Notify! It wants to join election this term, the validitor should register before election point.

## Step 3: Wait for election result

Above introduce, the election point is block number that counts backwards 200 at a multiple of ten thousand generally.

After election point, it can query that the validitor is selected or not. But the selected validitor start to work at Epoch started point, i.e. block number is a multiple of ten thousand.

## Step 4: Synchronize enough block

If the validiter isn't registered first, it wants to become relayer continue that needs to complete enough workload.

In order to reappointment, the current relayers need to synchronize 10000 blocks from other blockchain to atlas.

## Step 5: Withdraw your registered asset

If the validitor wants to quit, it should unregister balance at contract. The balance will be locked at this epoch and next epoch.

After two epochs, it will add to unlocked balance, can withdraw directly from the contract.
